ShaderSense is a language extension for Visual Studio that provides Intellisense features for High Level Shader Language. The Intellisense features include tooltips, auto-completions, member completions and parameter info. Additionally, it also does some amount checking for syntax errors, and highlights these errors with a red wavy underline. Auto-completion is a list of items that pops up during coding that a person can select from to quickly insert into the code. Member completion is a list of items that pops up after a person types a period following a structure variable, and this list contains the members of that structure type. Parameter info gives a tooltip-like box after typing an open parenthesis following a function name which shows the function signature and highlights the current parameter that the programmer should enter.
